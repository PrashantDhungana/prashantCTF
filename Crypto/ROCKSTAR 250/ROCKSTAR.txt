Prashant is right              
Upu is wrong                
A guitar is a six-string        
Raman's been down               
Music is a billboard-burning razzmatazz!
Listen to the music             
If the music is a guitar                  
Say "Keep on rocking!"                
Listen to the rhythm
If the rhythm without Music is nothing
Raman is rockin guitar
Shout Raman!                    
Music is amazing sensation 
Jamming is awesome presence
Scream Music!                   
Scream Jamming!                 
Raman is playing rock           
Scream Raman!       
They are dazzled audiences                  
Shout it!
Rock is electric heaven                     
Scream it!
Raman is jukebox god            
Say it!                                     
Break it down
Shout "Bring on the rock!"
Else Whisper "That ain't it, Chief"                 
Break it down
